To flash the firmware to your keyboard, connect one half of your board to your computer then double click the reset button on the bottom of the case. You should see a removable drive appear. Drag the corresponding firmware file to that drive and wait for it to reboot.

Once your keyboard reboots, you can move on to flashing the other side. Be sure to flash the correct firmware file for each side (i.e. left for left board, right for right board).
